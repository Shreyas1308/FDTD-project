# FDTD-project
Project in Electronic Compatibility course, using Matlab and openEMS software

openEMS software can be found at http://openems.de/start/index.php

Run movie.m using predefined parameters, postprocessing.m can also be used for displaying more results.

Some results are accseible ffrom the link file where pictures for testcases are uploaded. See the video for a complete view of the phenomenon for different z-slices.

The basic concepts are to estimate how the radiation patterns of an antenna (modelled as a dipole) are subject to change in presence of a human head. The shape of the human head is considered a sperical one, and its size can be modified whether we are studying an adult or a child case. The parameters under examination are SAR, input impedance Z_in and the reflection coefficient S11. Related ideas can be studied in the following links:
